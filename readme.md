ESP Neopixel MQTT Driver
------------------------
*a really badly named project*

This is a (very) bespoke **Arduino** project that bridges MQTT control data and Neopixel. It is part of a larger suite of *(extremely)* bespoke apps to automate my home.

Feel free to fork/modify/copy for your own purposes, or make it more generic and do a PR, whatever floats your boat.
